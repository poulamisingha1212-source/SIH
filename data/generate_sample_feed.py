"""
Synthetic MPLADS Dataset Generator v2.
Generates a realistic, highly connected long-format dataset covering Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha works
across all Indian states, with full vendor links, expenditure vouchers, completion dates, and MP allocation limits.

Improvements over v1 (better statistical realism / correlations):
  1. Sanction amounts are drawn from a category-specific triangular distribution instead of one
     flat uniform range for every category (roads cost more than bar-association grants, etc).
  2. Number of works per MP is correlated with the MP's performance profile (low/avg/high), so
     total fund utilization emerges from the data instead of being force-set per work.
  3. Work status is now correlated with elapsed time since sanction AND the MP's profile (a
     "high" profile MP has a shorter expected completion time and lower stall probability than
     a "low" profile MP) -- in v1, status was independent of any date, which is unrealistic.
  4. Fixed a v1 bug where a "Works Completed" record could be emitted even when work_status was
     not "Work Completed" (70% of the time, regardless of actual status). Now "Works Completed"
     records only exist for works whose status is actually "Work Completed".
  5. Disbursed fraction of the sanctioned amount is now a function of both status and profile
     (low-profile completed works often show incomplete disbursement; high-profile completed
     works cluster near/slightly-over 100% reflecting cost escalation).
  6. Number of expenditure installments scales with sanction amount (a 40 lakh work is paid in
     more tranches than a 1 lakh work), and installment dates are spread between sanction and
     completion/today instead of being independently random.
  7. Vendors are now correlated with work category (solar vendor does solar work, water-tech
     vendor does water work, etc.) instead of being picked uniformly at random from one pooled list.
  8. Cost outliers are now category-relative multipliers (e.g. 2-3.5x a category's own typical
     cost) instead of one flat absolute value applied identically to every category.
